# SmartCity Portal — Parallax Black & Gold Theme

Files:
- `index.html` — Home page (parallax background, animated particles, service cards)
- `meter-login.html` — Login page (autofill demo credential button)
- `dashboard.html` — Dashboard (recharge + transaction history)
- `assets/black-gold.png` — **Place your provided image here** (rename to this path)

## Setup
1. Create repository and place these files at the root.
2. Create an `assets` folder and add the background image as `assets/black-gold.png`.
3. Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (main branch, root).
4. Visit the published URL.

## Notes
- This is a **demo** — authentication and payments are simulated and rely on `localStorage`.
- For production: add a secure backend, server-side persistence and integrate a payment gateway (Razorpay/PayU/Stripe).
